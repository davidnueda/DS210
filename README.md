# DS210 Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression in Rust
DS210 Final

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression implemented in Rust. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning and data analysis, containing information about the passengers on the RMS Titanic.

Features
Preprocessing of the Titanic dataset
Implementation of logistic regression using gradient descent
Calculation of the correlation between different factors and survival rate
Predictions of passenger survival based on learned weights

Project Structure
The project contains two main modules: preprocessing and logistic_regression.

preprocessing: This module handles data preprocessing, including reading the input CSV file, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.
logistic_regression: This module implements logistic regression using gradient descent to learn the weights associated with each feature. It also includes functions to make predictions and calculate the correlation between different factors and survival rate.
